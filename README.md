**SPM projects**

You can create and work with SPM projects using Nimble. It is faster than using Xcode.

## Motivation

We are developing Nimble as a tools platform for <img width="12" alt="Scade logo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15704847/136028976-be275d45-0043-44f4-999b-afe57aa43c30.png"> [SCADE](https://www.scade.io/). <br> <img width="12" alt="Scade logo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15704847/136028976-be275d45-0043-44f4-999b-afe57aa43c30.png"> [SCADE](https://www.scade.io/) is a tools, freamework and SDK which allows you implement native crosplatform applications for iOS and Android using Swift.

## Source code

Nimble is a document-based Cocoa application written in Swift.

### Development Environment

- macOS 10.15 Catalina or higher
- Xcode 12.4 or higher
- Swift 5.3.2 or higher

### How to Build

1. Run following commands to resolve dependencies.
    - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Open `Nimble.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
1. Build "Nimble" scheme in the workspace.

### Extendable

We disined it to be extendable by plugins. The [.xctemplate](/Templates) allows every developer create their own plugin in several clicks. To implement yours ideas you can use API which we designed by proof-of-concept priciple. Our plugins such [ProjectNavigator](/Plugins/ProjectNavigator), [CodeEditor](/Plugins/CodeEditor), [BuildSystem](/Plugins/BuildSystem), [SwiftExtensions](/Plugins/SwiftExtensions) show examples of using API.
