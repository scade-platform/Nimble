## Swift support

We really love Swift, that's why we chose it as the first language with rich support in Nimble.

## Motivation

We are developing Nimble as a tools platform for <img width="12" alt="Scade logo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15704847/136028976-be275d45-0043-44f4-999b-afe57aa43c30.png"> [SCADE](https://www.scade.io/). <br> <img width="12" alt="Scade logo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15704847/136028976-be275d45-0043-44f4-999b-afe57aa43c30.png"> [SCADE](https://www.scade.io/) is a collection of tools, a framework and an SDK which allows you to develop native crossplatform applications for iOS and Android using Swift.

## Source code

Nimble is a document-based Cocoa application written in Swift.

### Development Environment

- macOS 10.15 Catalina or higher
- Xcode 12.4 or higher
- Swift 5.3.2 or higher

### How to Build

1. Run the following command to resolve dependencies.
    - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Open `Nimble.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
1. Build "Nimble" scheme in the workspace.

### Extendable

We designed Nimble to be extendable by plugins. The [.xctemplate](/Templates) allows every developer to create their own plugin in several clicks. To help you quickly implement your ideas, we provide an API which was initially designed for our personal use and iteratively improved to its current state. Our plugins, such as  [ProjectNavigator](/Plugins/ProjectNavigator), [CodeEditor](/Plugins/CodeEditor), [BuildSystem](/Plugins/BuildSystem) and [SwiftExtensions](/Plugins/SwiftExtensions) show examples of using this API.
